As a new developer and user, I want an application where I can select a range of numbers to narrow down the number I want,
then I want to select a number within that range,
then I want to see the mathmatical results of that number being added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided by 
another number of my choice

GIVEN THE CONSOLE APPLICATION IS OPENED
WHEN YOU RUN IT
WHEN IT SAYS "HELLO WORLD"
THEN CHANGE IT TO "PLEASE SELECT AN OPTION:"

GIVEN THE CONSOLE APPLICATION IS OPENED

BONUS:
Validation ideas
Given the app options
When the user types in option "A" (uppercase)
then ensure that option a is still selected (hint: toLowercase())

GIVEN THE APP OPTIONS
WHEN THE USER TYPES IN ANYTHING THAT ISN'T THE SINGLE LETTER OPTIONS
THEN PRODUCE A MESSAGE THAT SAYS "PLEASE SELECT A VALID OPTION"
THEN REPRINT THE PLEASE SELECT MESSAGE WITH OPTIONS

/////////////////////////


Given the console application is opened
when you run it
when it says "Please select an option:"
when the user types in a selection and presses enter
when print out "you've selected numbers $number-$numbers" is displayed
when asked to "Please pick a number between "$number" and "$number"
then read the users number they entered
then display "that is not a valid entry" if the entry is anything but an option in the chosen range
then ask the previoius question again
(**hint this is a good place to see the similarities and differences with if/else and loops.  You can use a for or foreach loop to cycle through possibilities)
