Validation ideas
Given the app options
When the user types in option "A" (uppercase)
then ensure that option a is still selected (hint: toLowercase())

Given the app options
When the user types in anything that isn't the single letter options
then produce a message that says "please select a valid option"
then reprint the please select message with options
